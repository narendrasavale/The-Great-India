    <br>

    <p>
        
Indian freedom fighters, a diverse array of individuals spanning different ideologies, backgrounds, and regions, collectively formed the backbone of India's struggle for independence against British colonial <mark>Mahatma Gandhi</mark>, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," spearheaded the nonviolent civil disobedience movement, emphasizing the principles of truth and nonviolence to mobilize millions in the fight for freedom. His leadership, marked by acts of peaceful resistance like the Salt March and Quit India Movement, galvanized the nation and garnered international attention, ultimately leading to India's liberation in 1947. Alongside Gandhi stood towering figures like Jawaharlal Nehru, whose eloquent advocacy for socialism and secularism shaped the vision of a modern, democratic India. The fiery rhetoric and militant tactics of leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose, who formed the <u>Indian National Army (INA)</u>  and allied with Axis powers during World War II, offered an alternative, more confrontational approach to liberation. Women such as <i>Sarojini Naidu, Annie Besant, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay</i>  played pivotal roles in the freedom movement, challenging gender norms and contributing significantly to the struggle through activism, leadership, and intellectual prowess. The sacrifices of <mark>Bhagat Singh</mark> , Chandrasekhar Azad, and countless others who laid down their lives for the cause of independence remain etched in the collective memory of the nation. Their collective efforts, marked by resilience, unity, and sacrifice, serve as a beacon of inspiration for future generations, reminding us of the power of ordinary individuals to bring about extraordinary change. Today, their legacy endures as a testament to the enduring spirit of freedom and democracy in India.
