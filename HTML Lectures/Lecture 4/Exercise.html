            Dear Mr. Doe
        </p>
        <p>
            I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of widgets. Approximately two weeks ago, on October 1, I ordered a total of 50 widgets for company, Ic. via the Widgets Galore client webpage. I received an email notification two days later confirming the receipt of payment and the shipment of the widgets. According to your website, shipments should reach their destination withing 3-5 business days of being sent, but I have yet to receive the widgets. Do you have any information on what may have happened to delay the shipment or where the shipment is currently?

        </p>
        <p>
            U gave worked with Widgets Galore, Inc. in hte past and have the greatest confidence in your products and customer servicve. We need the shipment of widgets soon, however, and I hoped you might be able to provide me with an idea of when I can expect them. Thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,
        </p>
